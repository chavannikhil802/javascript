// Question 1 - Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
let a  = "nikhil";
let b = 1809;
console.log(a+b);
// Here, a and b gets concatenated and the out is a string

// Question 2 - Use the typeof operator to find the datatype of the variable in question 1.
console.log(typeof (a+b));

const a  = {
    name: "Nikhil",
    section: 1,
    isPrincipal: false
};
